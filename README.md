ExoSkel
=======

ExoSkel is a collection of small modifications to the Skeleton CSS Boilerplate system

ExoSkel adds a 1280px layout for going beyond the 960px grid supported by skeleton. ExoSkel also builds in sticky footers (example provided in default index page) and a "fullWidth" class that can be used quickly to use 100% of the browsers width (see the HR in the default index page).
